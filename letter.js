const letter = `I just want you to know something…

Thank you for being you.
You make my days lighter, and my heart calmer.
I’m really happy I get to talk to you.
I really hope that someday we'll be together forever.
I'm really glad that you have become a person in my life.
I hope that no matter what happens we'll be able to get through
it all, I love you so much. Thank you for everything you have done.
You're the best Girlfriend in the world and nothing would change that.

Happy Valentine’s 💗
— Leo`;
